From @drnic -- sorry for missing updates recently. CI is fixed and we're now up to v5.7.

Changes to Team Edition and Enterprise Edition (release v5.4 .. v5.7):
------------

* Under SqlSettings:‚Äù in config.json:
  * Added "EnablePublicChannelsMaterialization": true, to increase channel search performance in the channel switcher (CTRL/CMD+K), channel autocomplete (~) and elsewhere in the UI.

* The `mattermost-hostname` BOSH variable has been renamed to `mattermost-siteurl` to more closely map to Mattermost configuration naming.
